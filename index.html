    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Alan Turing was a revolutionary British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine and played a pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma machine codes during World War II, which lead to the Allied victory. Turing's enduring legacy also includes his influential proposal of the Turing Test as a theoretical test for machine intelligence, making him a key figure in the history of computing and artificial intelligence. Turing would later take his own life after being persecuation for his homosexuality at the age of 41 in 1954.
