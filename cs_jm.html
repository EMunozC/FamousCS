    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p> John McCarthy, from a younge age demonstrated an  interest for mathematics and logic from his intellectual parents. He earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and later pursued graduate studies at Princeton University. McCarthy's work in artificial intelligence began in the 1950s while he was a faculty member at Dartmouth College, where he organized the Dartmouth Conference, widely regarded as the birth of AI as a field of study. Throughout his career, McCarthy continued to innovate, developing influential theories and technologies that have shaped the landscape of computer science and artificial intelligence. 
In recognition of his groundbreaking contributions, John McCarthy was awarded the Turing Award in 1971 further solidifying his legacy.</p>
    
    <h4>Notable Contributions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1956: Coined the term "artificial intelligence" (AI)  at the Dartmouth Conference which laid the groundwork for the field and defined its scope. </li>
      <li>1958: Invented the Lisp programming language - used for AI research and software development, becoming a foundational language in the AI field.</li>
      <li>1978: Received the Turing Award which recognized his contributions to AI and Lisp, cementing his status as a pioneer in computer science.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Famous Quote</h4>
    <blockquote>Mankind will probably survive even if it doesn't take my advice.</blockquote>
    
    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>John McCarthy is often referred to as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence" due to his revolutionary work in the field.</li>
      <li>McCarthy was critical of the programming language COBOL, referring to it as "a significant disaster in the history of computing."</li>
      <li>McCarthy's interest in logic and mathematics was influenced by his parents</li>
      <li>Asides from Computer Science, Mccarthy is also interested in the science behind the consciousness and rationality.</li>
